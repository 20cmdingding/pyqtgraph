Description: Scientific Graphics and GUI Library (Python 2)
 PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 and numpy. 
 It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications. 
 Despite being written entirely in python, the library is very fast due to its 
 heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching and Qt's GraphicsView framework 
 for fast display.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
